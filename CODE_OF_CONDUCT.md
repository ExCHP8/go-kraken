# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Respectful and Inclusive Language:** Use welcoming and inclusive language. Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- **Be Courteous:** Respect the time and effort of other contributors. Be patient and understanding in communications.
- **Be Collaborative:** Collaborate effectively and work towards common goals.
- **Focus on the Project:** Avoid any form of harassment, discrimination, or disruptive behavior that does not contribute to the project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment and Intimidation:** Any form of harassment, intimidation, or discrimination will not be tolerated.
- **Trolling and Personal Attacks:** Deliberately insulting, trolling, or attacking other contributors is not acceptable.
- **Unwelcome Attention:** Unwanted attention, such as unwarranted flirting or sexual advances, is inappropriate.
- **Disruption:** Any disruptive or disrespectful behavior that hinders the progress of the project is not allowed.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions, comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [here](mailto:jorgeferrerolinacero@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project's leadership.
